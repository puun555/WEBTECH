    <h1>Programming language</h1>
    <p>A programming language is a formal language which comprises a set of instructions
        used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to create
        programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>C</h1>
        <p>C is a general-purpose,
            imperative computer
            programming language,
            supporting structured
            programming, lexical
            variable scope and
            recursion, while a static
            type system prevents
            many unintended
            operations.</p>

    <div class="center">
        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>Python is an interpreted
            high-level programming
            language for general-
            purpose programming.
            Python has a design
            philosophy that emphasizes
            code readability, notably
            using significant
            whitespace.</p>

    <div class="right">
        <h1>java</h1>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose
            computer-programming
            language that is
            concurrent, class-based,
            object-oriented, and
            specifically designed to
            have as few
            implementation
            dependencies as possible.</p>
